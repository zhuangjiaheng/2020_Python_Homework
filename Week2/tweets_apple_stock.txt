Mostly when a recession happens a new revolution starts to take place for example in 2007/08/09 $AAPL launched the iPhone and after that, it just changed the whole phone industry. The same is happening for $TSLA and @elonmusk rn, an automotive revolution has begun to take shape.

Wow, what a week for vacation. I sold my metals verts a week ago. Still holding the bearish $SPX positions as they climb in value. The bearish $AAPL vert is still recovering from the positive ER, and the $AMZN and $QQQ verts are doing well. Hold onto them.
@TheTurbatron @zerohedge You do realize that the S&amp;P is beating $AAPL by almost 9% for the year over year period, right? AAPL is down 6.5% since last August. All those buybacks for what?
